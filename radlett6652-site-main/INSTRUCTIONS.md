# Which text would you like moved down?

Please tell me which page and which specific text you'd like moved down:

## Option 1: Home Page
- Text: "Radlett Lodge No. 6652" and subtitle
- Background: Masonic pillars image
- File: src/pages/HomePage.tsx

## Option 2: About Page  
- Text: "About Radlett Lodge No. 6652" and subtitle
- Background: Lodge interior image
- File: src/pages/AboutPage.tsx

## Option 3: Join Page
- Text: "Join Radlett Lodge No. 6652" and subtitle  
- Background: Meeting room image
- File: src/pages/JoinPage.tsx

## Option 4: Other page
- Please specify which page

Once you tell me, I'll immediately implement the changes to move the text down toward the bottom so it doesn't obscure your main picture.
